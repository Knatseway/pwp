<p> At the very top of the page, I would like to include  an interactive navigation bar that has a transparent background with a  collapsable menu. The items will connect or goto (reference) the cards at the bottom of the screen.  Upon opening the page, I would like to see one full screen of photo.  The background can be solid by choice but since I need skills in editing photos, it might have a background until I can get a photo in front of a green screen.  Object : get a photo in front of a green screen to have a solid color background behind subject.  </p> <p>In the box below the photo box and navbar, I would like to put an about me section. This area will consist of some of the groups and activities the subject is involved in at school and during the summer. </p>
<p>Portfolio section: The bottom section of the site will have a card grid of up to 6 cards.  They will include photos and references to DCI experience, Stage performances, tech experience, Awards section, etc. Video clips would be best but photos here will work.</p>
