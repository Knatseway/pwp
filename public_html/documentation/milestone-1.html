    <title> Personal Website Project </title>

    <p><strong>Purpose of site:</strong>
        My son is majoring in Music Performance with an emphasis in percussion.  His studio teacher has suggested that students create a website to promote themselves before graduation.  The assignment is given during Freshman year and is not to be graded but highly recommended before graduation.  When I started the bootcamp, my son shared this studio assignment and I agreed to make him a personal studio website for marketing purposes.

    <p><strong>Audience:</strong>
        Percussion students of all ages are the target audience for this personal website. The URL can be shared at music schools, journals, in person with students and colleagues, and his college peer group in the music department.  Studio students in music come in all ages and professions.  Sharing the URL in any live public forum or with any and, everyone on social media is common.
    </p>

<div>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong>
        The goal of this site will be networking and to fill a percussion studio.  Freelancing is common in music but the people who are the best at networking are the ones who get the most job opportunities.  The site will be a tool in this aspect to recruit new students and promote the percussion studio.
